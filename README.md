## What is this app all about?
The app aims to imitate the popular British game "Where's Waldo" in a fun and challenging way. Your goal is to find a certain character (e.g Waldo) in a big image with many more characters.

## What's the game "Where's Waldo" all about?
Where's Waldo is a British series of children's puzzle books created by English illustrator Martin Handford. The books consist of a series of detailed double-page spread illustrations depicting dozens or more people doing a variety of amusing things at a given location. Readers are challenged to find a character named Waldo hidden in the group.

Waldo is identified by his red-and-white-striped shirt, bobble hat, and glasses, but many illustrations contain red herrings involving deceptive use of red-and-white striped objects. Later entries in the long-running book series added other targets for readers to find in each illustration. The books have also inspired two television programmes (Where's Waldo? the 1991 animated series and Where's Waldo? the 2019 animated series), a comic strip and a series of video games.
